# React Native Project - CRM PROJECT

## Project Requirements

The project aims to create a hybrid mobile application for sales representatives using React Native that provides the following functionality:

1. Download the app on Android and iOS mobile devices.
2. View customers in their region.
3. View individual customer information.
4. Create new potential customers.
5. Update data for existing customers.
6. Set reminders for contacting specific customers at a set time.

## User-Facing Screens

The following user-facing screens are required to meet the project requirements:

1. Welcome page: A landing page that displays static text.
2. Region list view: Allows users to select their region and view customers in their region. The view also includes a button for creating a new user that links to the customer create view.
3. Customers by region: This view displays customer name and status. Selecting a customer takes the user to that customer's detail page.
4. Customer detail page: This view will show a single customer's information and will hold more detailed information in future iterations of the application. The view contains a link to edit the customer information.
5. Customer create/edit form: This view holds a form for either creating or editing a user, depending on the parameters sent to the page.
